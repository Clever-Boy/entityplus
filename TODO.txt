- Pickup sounds for holdable_key_* entities

- "Use" sounds for holdable_key_* entities



- Test bot AI to see if they really don't initiate attacks on each other

- Make func_breakable play a sound when it's broken




- See if we can make a -1 value for the wait key of func_door entities to behave like the -2 value is working now (and check if it isn't already working like that).
  ANSWER: no, -1 is return immediately and this does exactly what it says it does

- Test the effects of target_disable on various entities, most importantly spawn points.
  ANSWER: target_disable does not do a thing on spawnpoints. A new implementation makes sure that an info_player_deathmatch that's targeted by a 
  trigger will be enabled/disabled by firing the trigger.
