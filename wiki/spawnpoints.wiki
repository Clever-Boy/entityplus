=Spawnpoints=

The following (spawnpoint) entities all have an added "count" key:

  *info_player_start
  *info_player_deathmatch
  *team_CTF_redplayer
  *team_CTF_redspawn
  *team_CTF_blueplayer
  *team_CTF_bluespawn

The count key limits the number of times a player can spawn at this spawnpoint. When omitted or set to 0, players can spawn at this spawnpoint indefinitely.

WARNING: Be careful with this functionality, as a map without active spawnpoints will result in problems.
