= trigger_death =

Triggered when a player dies.

= Keys =

  * target : this points to the entity to activate.
  * nobots : dying bots do not trigger this entity.
  * nohumans : dying humans do not trigger this entity.
  * count : the number of players that must have died before this entity is triggered
  * notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
  * notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
  * notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
  * notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.

= Spawnflags =

  * RED_ONLY : only red team players can activate trigger.
  * BLUE_ONLY : only blue team players can activate trigger.
  * TRIGGER_ONCE : The trigger will only fire once

= Notes =

When the count key is set, the trigger_death must effectively be triggered [count] number of times before it actually fires its targets. The trigger_death entity is considered to be triggered only when a player that matches the entity's nobots/nohumans/red_only/blue_only configuration has died. Note that the count specifies a total number of deaths, not a per-player count.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
