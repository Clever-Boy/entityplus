= Keys =

  * targetname : activating trigger points to this.
  * target : this points to entities to enable/disable when this entity is triggered
  * notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
  * notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
  * notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).

= Spawnflags =

  * RED_ONLY : only red team players can activate trigger.
  * BLUE_ONLY : only blue team players can activate trigger.
  * ALWAYS_DISABLE : The targeted entity will always be disabled.
  * ALWAYS_ENABLE : The targeted entity will always be enabled.
  * IMMEDIATELY : The target_disable will enable/disable it's targeted entities when it is spawned.

= Notes =

By default the target_disable entity works as a toggle, so enabled entities will be disabled and disabled entities will be enabled.
Disabled trigger`_` entities will stop firing their targets when disabled. It is possible to target other entities as well, but the results vary per entity type and are untested.
