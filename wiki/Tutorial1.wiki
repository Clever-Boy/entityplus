=Tutorial 1: A basic map=

Before you can create a map for !EntityPlus, you'll need a few things:
  * A legal copy of [http://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/ Quake III Arena], updated to version 1.32 or 1.32c.
  * [http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/ GtkRadiant] version 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6.
  * The [https://code.google.com/p/entityplus/downloads/list EntityPlus mod].
  * The mod download package contains the manual, but it is available as stand alone download in the [https://code.google.com/p/entityplus/downloads/list downloads section] as well.
  * If you are using !GtkRadiant 1.5, then you will need to download the entities.ent file for !GtkRadiant 1.5 as well.

If you want to know how to configure !GtkRadiant to use !EntityPlus, then refer to the !EntityPlus manual.

==Creating the map==

Simply follow these basic steps to create your first map:

  * Create an empty box room.
  * Place an info_player_start entity somewhere in the room.
  * Create a trigger_multiple entity and give it a wait key of -1.
  * Create a target_finish entity and have the trigger_multiple entity target the target_finish entity.
  * Compile the map

Congratulations! You've just created your first !EntityPlus map! It's just an empty map that does nothing, but you can walk into the trigger_multiple entity and the game will switch to the final scoreboard view.
