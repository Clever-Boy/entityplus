= Notes =

When the count key is set, the trigger_frag must effectively be triggered [count] number of times before it actually fires its targets. The trigger_frag entity is considered to be triggered only when a player that matches the entity's nobots/nohumans/red_only/blue_only configuration has scored a frag. Note that the count specifies a total number of frags, not a per-player count.

This entity will be triggered only when a player kills another player. The player scoring the frag is seen as the activator of the trigger*/
