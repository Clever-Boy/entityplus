= shooter_bfg =

This will shoot a bfg projectile each time it's triggered. Aiming is done by setting the "angles" key or by targeting an info_notnull or target_position entity.

= Keys =

  * angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of shooter (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.
  * targetname : activating trigger points to this.
  * target : this points to a target_position entity for aiming the grenades.
  * random : random aiming variance in degrees from the straight line to the targeted entity (default 0 - see Notes).
  * notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
  * notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
  * notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).

= Spawnflags =

None

= Notes =

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a maximum angle deviation from the normal trajectory formed by a straight line between the shooter and the aiming entity it targets. The final trajectory will be a random value anywhere between no deviation at all (0) to maximum deviation (value of the random key).

Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the shooter. However, the target_position method is simpler.
